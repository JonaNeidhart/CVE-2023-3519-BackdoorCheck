# cve-2023-3519-citrix-scanner

This script is a basic Citrix Scanner for CVE-2023-3519.
We try to identify vulnerable Citrix Gateways/ADCs by looking at the HTTP headers.

## How it works

During our analysis of this vulnerability, we and our friends at [CERT-Verbund](https://www.cert-verbund.de/) noticed, that our patched systems had the same HTTP header `Last-Modified` timestamp.

Note that reverse proxies and heavily customised front pages may alter the results.
This script should not be your only method of checking that you are not vulnerable.

Our current known timestamps are:

| Patch | Last-Modified Timestamp |
| --- | --- |
| 13.1-49.13 | `Mon, 10 Jul 2023 17:41:17 GMT` |
| 13.1-49.13 | `Mon, 10 Jul 2023 18:36:14 GMT` |
| 13.0-91.13 | `Fri, 07 Jul 2023 15:39:40 GMT` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/cve-2023-3519-citrix-scanner
